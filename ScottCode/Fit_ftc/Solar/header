! AIRS solar data file for SRF=031115v3
!
! Data for 649-1614 cm-1 comes from M.P. Thekaekara, 1973 Solar
! Energy v.14 p.109-127 (supplied to us by Chris Barnet).  The ~80
! cm-1 point spacing data has been interpolated to the AIRS
! channel freqs and converted to W/(m2.sr.cm-1).
!
! Data for 2181-2665 cm-1 comes from ATMOS Solar Spectra, and was
! supplied to us by ATMOS Principal Investigator Michael Gunson.
! In particular we used the file "atmos_corrected_solar.mat".
! This data was then directly convolved with the estimated AIRS
! SRFs for each channel to approximate the effective AIRS solar.
