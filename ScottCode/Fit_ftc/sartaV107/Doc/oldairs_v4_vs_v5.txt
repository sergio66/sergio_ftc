Changes to the AIRS-RTA for PGE version 5
-----------------------------------------
Scott Hannon, 02 May 2007   <hannon@umbc.edu>

The AIRS fast forward model used by the PGE version 5
(AIRS-RTA v5) is the same basic model as used in version 4,
but with the changes and additions noted below.

Changes:

1) The coefficient database for AIRS channels 1-130 (comprising
detector module 12) were replaced to correct for a frequency
error which was present in all previous versions.

2) The optical depth tuning adjustments were redone to make use
of the much larger set of validation data available since the
v4 tuning was developed.  The v5 tuning was also extended
to stratospheric channels in collaboration with the AIRS
retrieval team.

3) The algorithm used to estimate the radiance contribution from
reflected downwelling atmospheric thermal emission was replaced.
The new algorithm required some restructuring of the radiative
transfer code for computational efficiency, but it provides a
more accurate estimate at little extra computational cost.

4) The algorithm responsible for handling the variability of
trace gas CO2 was modified to allow for more flexibility. In
v4 the CO2 variability was limited to an overall profile scale
factor, while in v5 the variability can individually adjusted
in each AIRS layer.

Additions:

5) Coefficients and code were added to allow modelling of
the variability of trace gases SO2, HNO3, and N2O.  These gases
were previously "fixed".

6) Coefficients and code were added to model the effects
of non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium in the AIRS shortwave
stratospheric channels during daytime.
