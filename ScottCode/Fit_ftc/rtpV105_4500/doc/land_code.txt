Comments on the RTP profile variable "landtype".
Last updated: Scott Hannon,  7 December 2001

The land type code number is intended as a means of tracking the type
of land (if any) within the field of view of the observing instrument.

There is currently no pre-defined land code.

Suggests & comments:

The RTP emissivity (& reflectivity) for each profile should represent
the entire FOV of the observing instrument.  In the case where the FOV
includes multiple surface types, it may be necessary to compute a
weighted average emissivity for the surface.

The landtype should apply to just landfrac, not the entire FOV.
The remainder (1 - landfrac) is assumed to be ocean surface.

The landtype variable is a 4-byte integer value with ~4 billion
possible values.  A table with 4 billion values isn't practical, so
it might make more sense to define a smaller land type table and
use the landtype variable to encode two separate types (primary and
secondary) by applying a power of 10 shift to the secondary data.
Since 4-byte integers can handle 8 digit (base 10) numbers, so we
could do something such as

   ccc%%CCC

where digits "CCC represent the primary land type code number
(with 999 possible values), and digits "ccc" present the secondary
land type with digits "%%" the percent land of this secondary type.
If the secondary type is omitted, this would mean the primary type
covers 100% of the land.

   Example: "4317002" would mean secondary land type 43 covers
   17 percent of the land, while primary land type 2 covers the
   remaining land (100 - 17 = 83 %).
