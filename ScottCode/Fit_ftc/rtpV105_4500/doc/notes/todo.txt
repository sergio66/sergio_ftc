RTP To Do List
---------------

write an rptcat utility

rtpread2 and rtpwrite2 should probably check open modes

test on more systems, especially 64-bit systems

Traceability could be aided with an informal annotation describing
a profile set's sources.  A more rigorous approach, e.g., assigning
unique ID's to profiles and listing a profiles parents, could be
undertaken but might be more trouble than it is worth.

Beyond some basic annotations, or checksums of entire files, the
business of authentication gets quite messy.  It is possible in
principle to have someone responsible for a set of profiles ``sign''
the set, similar to how mail can be signed and authenticated with
PGP, with the interesting additional complication that checksums or
other signatures of floating-point data must be taken from a
particular binary representation of that data---to implement this
you'd need for HDF to allow a sort of aliasing, that would let you
to see the internal HDF representation for a particular floating
point object as a sequence of integers.
