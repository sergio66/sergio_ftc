the following maxes were in the header file.

The C/Fortran API uses these to can be used to set the profile vdata
record sizes, they don't really need to be saved explicitly in the
header.  These fields could just be set to the MAX<blah> values, but
that could waste a lot of space, at least for MAXLEV vs mlevs

Size fields:

 mrho      max num of refl pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXRHO]
 memis     max num of emis pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXEMIS]
 mlevs     max number of levels   scalar int32   [0,MAXLEV]

 mwmemis   max MW emis pts	  scalar int32	 MWMAXEMIS
 mwmstb    max MW sTb pts	  scalar int32	 MWMAXSTB


the header should only have size fields for arrays that are
in the header, currently 

 - ngas, for glist and gunit;
 - nchan, for vchan and ichan, and
 - mwnchan, for mwfchan
