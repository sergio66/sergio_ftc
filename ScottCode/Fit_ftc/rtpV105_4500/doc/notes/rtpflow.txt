main steps for a write, with required predecessors

  1. build header and profile vdata and struct flists from 
     header structure values and static structure fields
     (lots of special cases, from header structure values).
     write open channel info

  with pvwrite1:
  2. open vdata
  3. attach to header and profile vdatas, 2
  4. write attributes, 2,3
  5. set profile and header field info for vdata, 1-4

  6. copy data to header and profile vdata buffers, 1-5

  with pvwrite2:
  7. write header and profile data, 1-5

  with pvwrite3:
  8. detach, 1-7

  with pvclose:
  9. close, 1-8


main steps for a read, with required predecessors

  with pvread1:
  1. open vdata
  2. attach to header and profile vdatas, 1
  3. read attributes 1,2
  4. read header and profile field info, 1,2

  5. build header and profile vdata and struct flists from
     read vdata fields an static structure fields, 1,2,4
     write open channel info

  with pvread2:
  6. read header and profile data, 1,2,4,5

  7. copy data from header and profile vdata buffers, 1,2,4-6

  with pvread3:
  8. detach, 1-7

  with pvclose:
  9. close, 1-8
