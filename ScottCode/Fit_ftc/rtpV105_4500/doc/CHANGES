V105: minor update, 02 Feb 2007
----
MAXGASID was increased from 70 to 204 to allow for an expanded list
of possible HITRAN and cross-section (XSEC) gas IDs.  Gas IDs 201-204
are intended for use with up to four cloud profiles (201=cloud1 to
204=cloud4).


V104 to V105 changes
---------------------

Version 105 is mainly a cleanup of low level C code to work better
with HDF character arrays, which were added in V104 as a data type.

On reads, the C/Fortran interface now handles vdata fields that are
longer than the C/Fortran structure fields better; over-size fields
are truncated and a warning is printed to stderr.

Some word-alignment problems on 64-bit IRIX systems were fixed.


V103 to V104 changes
---------------------

The following fields were added:

NEW HEADER FIELDS

  udef  - user define float32 array, to MAXUDEF
	  (this is in addition to the scalar udef1 and udef2)

NEW PROFILE FIELDS

Surface data

  smoist  - soil moisture fraction, float32 scalar, units pct

Atmospheric data

  txover  - temperature crossover pressure, e.g., from RAOB to model
  gxover  - constituent crossover pressure, float32 array, to MAXGAS

Common radiance data

  mwasang   - AMSU-A scan or view angle
  mwaszen   - AMSU-A satellite zenith angle
  mwbsang   - AMSU-B/HSB scan or view angle
  mwbszen   - AMSU-B/HSB satellite zenith angle

Observed radiance data

  calflag   - uchar8 string to MAXCHAN, the AIRS variable CalFlag

User defined 

  pnote  - char8 string, to MAXPNOTE, short profile description
  udef   - user define float32 array, to MAXUDEF
	   (this is in addition to the scalar udef1 and udef2)

The initialization and dump routines were updated to deal with
character arrays, and some assorted bug fixes and cleanups were
done.


V102 to V103 changes
---------------------

Added header fields 

  vcmin  - chan set min freq, including wings
  vcmax  - chan set max freq, including wings

Added profile field

  zobs   - satellite height


V101 to V102 changes
---------------------

Profile fields "pobs" (radiance observer pressure), "upwell"
(a flag for upwelling or downwelling radiation) and "landtype"
were added.

Profile fields were rearranged into slightly different groups:
surface data, MW surface data, atmospheric data, calculated radiance
data, and observed radiance data.

The old all-in-one package was broken up into bin, doc, include,
lib, src, test, and utils directories.  The makefiles were revised
to reflect this; the src directory makefile installs librtp.a in
the lib directory, and user-relevant include files in the "include"
directory.  The separate makefiles for Fortran and C programs were
merged.

A version string is now defined in rtp.h, and returned to Fortran
users by the "rtpvers" procedure

Attribute max length was increased to 1024.  This is set in
pvdefs.h, with the definition rtpdefs.f set to match.  

The following max values are now set in pvdefs.h, with corresponding
fields in rtpdefs.f

  #define MAXVNAME 64     /* bound vdata and field name length    */
  #define MAXANAME 64     /* bound attribute name length          */
  #define MAXATEXT 1024   /* bound single attribute value         */

Reading attributes that are too long now returns an error.

Scott's rtpsubset utility was added to the utils directory.

A top-level Makefile was added, allowing all build parmeters to
be set in one place.

A 4-byte fill variable was added to the profile structure to move the
8-byte real field "rtime" to an 8-byte boundary.  This was needed for
64-bit SGI IRIX, which seems to want 8-byte reals at 8-byte boundaries, 
even when "align_aggregate" was set to 2 or 4.


V100 to V101 changes
---------------------

TAI is now a float64

The Makefile has been updated to work with 64-bit IRIX, this
requires the HDF4.1r4 release.  (Probably r3 will also work,
though with some editing of the HDF build config files, but
r4 works with 64 bit IRIX with no extra tweaking.)

assorted documentation and bug fixes


V099 to V100 changes
---------------------

Instrument type codes were added for MW and IR instruments

 irinst        IR instrument code     scalar int
 mwinst        MW instrument code     scalar int

A cloud type field was added

 ctype         cloud type code        scalar int32

The following profile field names were change

 findex        file (granule) index,  was "granule"
 atrack        along-track index,     was "scanline"
 xtrack        cross-track index,     was "footprint"

field descriptions were added to the Fortran structure
definitions

Assorted bug fixes, thanks to feeback from Scott Hannon
and Phil Rosencranz


V098 to V099 changes
---------------------

The following max size fields have been removed from the RTP vdata
header record

 mrho      max num of refl pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXRHO]
 memis     max num of emis pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXEMIS]
 mlevs     max number of levels   scalar int32   [0,MAXLEV]

However, these three fields, plus two more MW fields

 mwmemis   max MW emis pts        scalar int32   [0,MWMAXEMIS]
 mwmstb    max MW sTb pts         scalar int32   [0,MWMAXSTB]

are still in the Fortran/C header structure.  Some discussion of
these fields was added to the Fortran API section of the RTP spec.
The main reminder there is that these need to be set to something 
between zero and the MAX, as the writer uses these values to set
the actual vdata field sizes. 

At Scott's suggestion the header field "lfract" was changed to
"landfrac", and "mwemiss" to "mwemis", also his bug fixes and
suggestions for the documentation were added.


V097 to V098 changes
---------------------

A new profile type AIRSLAY was created to flag the AIRS
pseudo-layers

The satellite and sun angle profile fields were modified and
extended as follows

  scanang       satellite scan angle       was satang
  satzen        satellite zenith angle     was satelv
  satazi        satellite azimuth angle    new field
  solzen        sun zenith angle           was sunang
  solazi        sun azimuth angle          new field

Other new profile fields

  lfract        land fraction
  wspeed        wind speed
  wsource       wind source
 
  mwnemis       number of MW emissivity points
  mwefreq       MW emissivity frequencies
  mwemiss       MW emissivities

  mwnstb        number of MW surface Tbs
  mwsfreq       MW surface Tb frequencies
  mwstb         MW surface Tbs

New observation fields

  granule       AIRS granule number
  scanline      AIRS scanline
  footprint     AIRS footprint number

New header fields

  mwnchan       number of MW channels  scalar int32   count
  mwvchan       MW channel freq's      nwmchan float  GHZ

Possibly deprecated header fields:

  mrho   [3]    max num of refl pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXRHO]
  memis  [3]    max num of emis pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXEMIS]
  mlevs  [3]    max number of levels   scalar int32   [0,MAXLEV]

These probably aren't needed since the Fortran and C users will
just use MAXRHO, MAXEMIS, and MAXLEV
