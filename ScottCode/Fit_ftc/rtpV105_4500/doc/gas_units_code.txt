C      RTP code numbers for various gas amount units
C      ---------------------------------------------
C
C      This is the recommended list of code numbers for various
C      gas amount units.  The list is not complete; it includes
C      only the most common units.  Additional units can be added
C      where ever there is a free number.
C
C      An attempt has been made to organize the gas amount units
C      into classes so that similar units have similar numbers.
C      This is merely an attempt to make it easier for users to
C      search the list for some particular unit.
C      The gas amount unit classes are as follows:
C         -9999 = no data
C             0 = unknown units
C        1 -  9 = integrated column density
C       10 - 19 = volume mixing ratio
C       20 - 29 = mass mixing ratio
C       30 - 39 = partial pressure
C       40 - 49 = water vapor humidity
C       50 - 59 = none-of-the-above oddball units
C       Negative numbers are not recommended as standard code numbers.
C       However, the user might possibly find it useful to use the
C       negative value of a code number to indicate some sort of
C       alternate interpretation of the units represented by the
C       positive valued number.  For example, the meaning of "air"
C       in mixing ratios might mean "dry air" if positive and "wet
C       air" if negative.
C
C      Note: currently the KLAYERS program only uses input=PPMV
C      and output=kilomoles/cm^2

C          0   unknown units (?)

C              ------- 1-9 = integrated column density -----------------
C              Note: The gas amount has been integrated over some finite
C              thickness vertical slab.  This "thickness" may correspond
C              to a single slab layer, or it might be the total column
C              from the current pressure level to the top of the
C              atmosphere.  This implicit "thickness" is a separate
C              piece of info which is required to correctly interpret
C              the meaning of the gas amounts.

C              ------- 10-19 = volume mixing ratio ---------------------
C              Note: the meaning of "air" can vary.  There are two
C              common usages with slightly different meanings.  The most
C              obvious (but less often encountered) meaning is to refer
C              to the air as it actually exists (aka "wet air") at the
C              corresponding pressure level.  But the most common
C              meaning is to refer to some simple idealized model of
C              air.  Typically this "dry air" is assumed to be composed
C              entirely of imaginary "air" molecules with an atomic
C              mass of roughly 28.966 AMU.  This distinction between
C              "wet" and "dry" air can affect the mixing ratio in the
C              lower troposphere by a few percent.

C              A Dobson Unit is a special type of integrated column

C              a bit obtuse:  1000 times the height (in centimeters)
C              of some column of ozone if it were squashed down to STP.
