A brief description of the SUBSET program
-----------------------------------------
Scott Hannon, 16 March 2001

The SUBSET program is a RTP utility program used to create a new
RTP by pulling out a subset of the data found in the input RTP file.
The subsetting may be done on:
   profiles
   channels
   gases
in any combination of the above.  For example, suppose some big
RTP file cotains 12000 profiles, and you only care about a few
of them, and furthermore you only care about a couple hundred
channels.  using the SUBSET program you can quickly and easily
create a new RTP file containing just the profiles and channels
you want.

The SUBSET prgram needs to be told what channels/profiles/gases
you are interested in.  If you don't say, it assumes you want them
all.  The profiles/channels/gases are specified by means of
simple ASCII 1 colun text files containing the ID/index of the
items of interest.  Channels are specified by channel ID number,
gases by (HITRAN) gas ID number, and profiles by index in the
input RTP.  These "list" text files all follow same format:
a single column of ASCII numbers.  The only difference is what
the numbers mean.  The lists *must* be sorted in ascending
order, and no repeats are allowed.


Command-line Arguments:
----------------------
Instructions for the program processing is handled by command-line
arguments.  The valid commands are:

    fin : name of input file; string [required]

    fout : name of output file; string [required]

    comment : new comment to be added to output RTP header; string
       Note: comment string should be enclosed in quotes

    chanlist : name of channel list textfile; string

    proflist : name of profile list textfile; string

    gaslist : name of gas list textfile; string


Example lists:
-------------
See files example_chanlist, example_proflist, example_gaslist.  This
example list files may be used with the "granule84.hdf" in the RTPip,
RTPop, and/or RTPrad dirs.
