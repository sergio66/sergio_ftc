README file for the AIRS fast model reflected downwelling thermal regression
used for the "v5" (aka "sarta_dec05" sartaV1.07) fast model.

Scott Hannon, 03 December 2007

Comment: I am unsure of the reasons for the use of two different
"rdown2" files and why the "long" data is a year older than the
"short" data.  The following is a vague recollection and might
be wrong: the shortwave wcon tuning is older (ie not modified as
recently) than the longwave tuning and was available in kcarta
while the longwave tuning was not.  The SARTA calculated "rdown2"
needs to be consistent with the kcarta transmittance and radiance
calculations, but accuracy is much less important than consistency
for these regression.
