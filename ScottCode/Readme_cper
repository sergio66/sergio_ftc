Assuming the top level directory you want to start copying from is
/home/sergio/want-to-copy and you want to put it in, say,
/asl/s1/want-to-copy, a simple one-liner would be:

rsync -av --exclude="*.dat" --exclude="*.mat" /home/sergio/want-to-copy /asl/s1

(*no ending '/' on the home of the destination, /asl/s1 in this
example)

This will create 'want-to-copy' and child directories under
/asl/s1 and then copy all files except those matching *.dat/*.mat.  If
you have a bunch of things to exclude, you can put the exclude
patterns into a file and read from that instead of having N
--excludes.

If rsync causes any concern, I would do a simple 2/3 step
copy and delete: - make a straight recursive copy of the directories
and all their contents - run 'find <path to directory I just made>
-name "*.dat" -o -name "*.mat" -print (make sure the files that come
up make sense as those you want to delete) - if last seems sensible,
re-run find command but replace '-print' with '-delete'
