Measured and estimated timings for the AIRS transmittances runs
---------------------------------------------------------------
The runs are for convolved transmittances for 48 profiles
using our FOW(P), FMW, and FCOW(p) breakout gases.  Type
FOW(p) is done for all channels, so we should not need to
do any separate production runs for Roger Saunders et al.

The run times do not include the reflected thermal runs, but
those are relatively short.

18 April 2002:
Took 18 hours to run "fmw" on taro/yam.

14 May 2002:
Estimate 32 hours to run "fcow" on taro.

15 May 2002:
Took a total of 76 hours (8 x 9.5h) for "fow_short" on airs9-16

16 May 2002:
Estimate 120 hours to run "fow_long" on taro/yam.

The runs can be done quicker by spreading the runs to multiple
processors, each doing a sub-set of the 48 profiles.
