Non-parametric regression is widely used in many scientific and
engineering areas, such as image processing and pattern recognition.

Non-parametric regression is about to estimate the conditional
expectation of a random variable:

E(Y|X) = f(X)

where f is a non-parametric function.

Based on the kernel density estimation technique, this code implements
the so called Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression algorithm particularly
using the Gaussian kernel. The default bandwidth of the regression is
derived from the optimal bendwidth of the Gaussian kernel density
estimation suggested in the literature. The code can also take care of
missing data.

Multivariant Kernel Regression and Smoothing
version 1.0 (118 KB) by Yi Cao

A multivariant Gaussian kernel regression and smoothing tool.

This function implements multivariant Gaussian kernel regression and
smoothing. A few examples show how it can be used to smooth 3-d noisy
images with missing data.

For tutorial purpose, the function is implemented in the simplest
form. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for beginners to learn
kernel regression.

The efficiency is improved in the updated version by searching
neighbours in the effective range.
